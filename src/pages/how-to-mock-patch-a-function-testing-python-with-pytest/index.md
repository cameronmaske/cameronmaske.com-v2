Let's get rid of the randomness in this test by mocking it out. <br/>Let's start off by importing mock that has been built into Python since version 3.3.<br/>If you are Python 2, however, you'll need to install it as a separate package.<br/>Next, let's point mock to the function we want to override or patch, in this case our random integer function.<br/>Let's set it to always return a value of 5 and let's tell mock to autospec that function And we'll see why that's important in a bit.<br/>Let's include an argument in our test function to grab that mock object.<br/>Let's run the test.... and it passes.<br/>So there can be a few common gotchas that can trip you up when mocking.<br/>When specifiying the path to what you wanna patch you need to take care to point it is being used, but not where it's defined. <br/>Let's see that in action and point to the random module or where it is defined. And we can see that our tests failed because it's not being mocked anymore. <br/>Speccing makes sure that anything mock tries to mimic it's original a bit more closely. We can see that in action by turning off autospecc'ing and let's add some nonsense to the argument in our random integer function. <br/>And now when we run our tests they pass and that's because an unspecced mock will literally take anything you throw at it.
